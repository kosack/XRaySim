# XRaySim
X-ray diffraction microscope simulation and visualization (April 1998)

This was my senior research project on the simulation of an x-ray 
diffration microscope for studing polycrystaline grain-boundary dymanics.

Released here for posterity. No idea if it still compiles. Was written for Microsoft VisualStudio 
and used *FLTK* for the GUI.
