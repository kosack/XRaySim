# XRaySim
X-ray diffraction microscope simulation and visualization (April 1998)

This was my senior research project on the simulation of an x-ray 
diffration microscope for studing polycrystaline grain-boundary dymanics.

No idea if it still compiles. Was written for Microsoft VisualStudio and used *FLTK* for the GUI
